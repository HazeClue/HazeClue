## 📘 Abstract

The HazeClue project offers an integrated AI-based platform to enhance mental performance through brain signal analysis (EEG), optional electrical stimulation (tDCS), and integration with wearable device data (such as smartwatches).
The platform allows real-time monitoring of mental state, detecting mind-wandering or mental fatigue, and providing smart stimulation or alerts to restore focus immediately.
It also includes a website for analyzing the quality of educational content and measuring student engagement via brain signals, enabling a scientific evaluation of teaching methods.

## 🧩 Overview

The human brain works as a black box processing millions of operations every moment.
HazeClue opens a window into this box through an integrated system combining:

* Real-time brainwave reading and analysis via the Neuro PlayGround Lite (NPG Lite) device.
* Optional smart electrical stimulation (tDCS) to improve focus and attention.
* Smartwatch data analysis to understand physical state (sleep, activity, HRV).
* AI that learns from user data and provides personalized recommendations.
* A web platform to evaluate educational content based on students’ neural responses.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

In daily life and education, individuals face issues such as:

* Decreased focus during study or work.
* Mental fatigue and reduced cognitive performance.
* Lack of awareness of reasons for performance decline (sleep, nutrition, stress).
* No scientific method to measure the quality of explanations or educational content.
* Risks of random electrical stimulation without intelligent control.
* Absence of comprehensive systems integrating EEG and wearable device data.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The system is designed as a multi-component smart platform including:

#### 🧠 1. Neurocognitive Performance Analysis

* Measure EEG signals from NPG Lite and analyze them (Beta for focus, Alpha for mind-wandering, Theta/Delta for drowsiness and stress).
* Detect mind-wandering or decreased focus in real-time.
* Build a baseline for each user’s mental performance.
* Integrate smartwatch data for comprehensive analysis.
* Track changes over time and compare with previous performance.

#### ⚡ 2. Smart Electrical Stimulation (tDCS)

* Optional and activated only by the user.
* Compatible with approved commercial devices (e.g., Flow or Halo Neuroscience).
* Closed-loop intelligent control based on real-time EEG data.
* Safe protocols to prevent over-stimulation.
* Non-electrical alternatives like Binaural Beats for users who prefer no stimulation.
* Safe modes for children with parental control.

#### 💪 3. Health Monitoring and Lifestyle

* Analyze the relationship between EEG data and physical activity.
* Smart alerts for sleep, activity, or nutrition (without providing medical diagnosis).
* Provide statistically-informed lifestyle recommendations.
* Notify users of recurring patterns of performance weakness.

#### 🌐 4. Educational Content Evaluation Website (Web Platform)

* Monitor a group of students while watching educational content.
* Generate heatmaps and attention timelines.
* Detailed reports showing strengths and weaknesses of content.
* Compare different teaching methods to measure effectiveness.
* Support institutional use (schools, universities, educational companies).

#### 🤖 5. Intelligent Personalization Engine (AI Engine)

* Learns from user data to provide personalized recommendations.
* Predicts focus decline before it occurs and suggests appropriate interventions.
* Provides motivational notifications and performance trend analysis over time.

##### ⚠️ The platform does not provide any pharmaceutical or therapeutic recommendations.

## 🧩 EEG Brainwave Explanation

| Wave Type | Frequency (Hz) | Associated State                      |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Delta** | 0.5–4          | Deep sleep / rest                     |
| **Theta** | 4–8            | Meditation / drowsiness / imagination |
| **Alpha** | 8–12           | Relaxation / calm alertness           |
| **Beta**  | 12–30          | Focus / attention / activity          |
| **Gamma** | 30–100         | Learning / memory / high cognition    |

These waves are analyzed to determine mental states (focus, mind-wandering, stress, sleep, etc.).

## ⚡ What is tDCS?

tDCS = Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
A non-invasive technique using low electrical current to stimulate specific brain regions through the scalp.
Helps improve focus, memory, and mood, and is also used in neuro-rehabilitation.

✅ Safe Usage:

* Session duration: 20–30 minutes maximum.
* Current: 0.5–2 mA only.
* Not for children or epilepsy patients without specialist supervision.
* Electrodes must be well-moistened to reduce skin resistance.
* Stop immediately if any discomfort occurs (headache, skin irritation).

## 🔒 Privacy & Ethics

* All data is anonymized when used for research.
* The app requests user consent before activating any stimulation session.
* Strict policies to protect brain data and health information.

## 🧾 Conclusion

HazeClue represents a new generation of BCI (Brain–Computer Interface) systems that combine neural measurement, smart stimulation, and cognitive analysis in one integrated system.
It provides a safe scientific experience for improving focus and attention, supports education and data-driven feedback, and opens new avenues for integrating neurotechnology into daily life.
